# CNN-Visualization: What are CNNs looking at?

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the current state-of-the art in image classification tasks. CNNs extract the feature vectors of the images. In this project, students can train a neural network and generate the heatmap of images showing which area of image is contributing more towards the correct prediction of a class which will result in a kind of heatmap generation. Basic understanding of neural networks and image processing and programming skills in python are highly recommended for the successful completion of this project.
